                      haven to the all-seeing eye of the collective â€” where
                      every sprout and lineage is cataloged for public
                      admiration and scrutiny. Deactivate to cloak your garden
                      in secrecy, known only to you, a silent rebellion against
                      the ever-watchful gaze.
